# craFTEr - realtime game editor for FTE game engine

craFTEr is just a test. Since FTE game engine (created by Spike) needs desperately an editor where creating levels, placing entities and so on, and since I hate NetRadiant / GTK Radiant family, I decided to create this little game editor where to place game entities in realtime.
It's quite unusable right now, but it should have the following features in a(very) remote future:
* Level editor
	* Moving / rotating / scaling entities in realtime
	* placing / duplicating / grouping entites
* Game editor
	* Test level in realtime just pressing a button
